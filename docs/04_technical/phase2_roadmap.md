# Phase 2 Roadmap — Application Layer

Goal: fully wired application layer — DB self-initialises on first run, all repositories active, user preferences
persisted and applied, shopping list generated from the active plan, and the UI covers all three feature areas.

## Completed during Phase 1 development

These tasks belong to Phase 2 but were built ahead of schedule:

| Task                    | What was built                                                                                               |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `WeeklyMealViewModel`   | Record in `com.example.suppergeist.service` — `date`, `dayLabel`, `mealType`, `mealName`                     |
| `MealPlanService`       | Coordinates three repositories; `dayLabel` formatted as `"Monday 6 Apr"`; week-start ordering is a display concern handled by `MainController`, not the service |
| `MainController` wiring | Constructs repositories + service in `initialize()`; calls `getWeeklyMeals(1, 2026-04-06)`; uses loaded `weekStartDay` to order grid columns |
| Data-driven weekly grid | Day labels and meal cards added dynamically; day label deduplication via `Set<LocalDate>`                    |

Remaining gap from this work: calorie labels show `"-- kcal"` placeholder — pending `NutritionService` (Phase 3).

---

## Task 1 — Strict `module-info.java` cleanup ✅

`requires org.xerial.sqlitejdbc` added; redundant `opens com.example.suppergeist` replaced with
`opens com.example.suppergeist.ui to javafx.fxml`; exports added for `model`, `service`, `database`, `repository`.

> As new packages are introduced, add an explicit `exports` declaration — missing declarations surface as confusing
> compile-time reflection errors rather than a clear "package not opened" message.

---

## Task 2 — Complete `DatabaseManager` ✅

`DatabaseManager` has `getConnection()` and `init()`. `init()` applies all DDL constants from `Schema.java` in order.
DB path is anchored to `~/.suppergeist/app.db` via `Path.of(System.getProperty("user.home"), ".suppergeist", "app.db")`.

> **`nutrients.db` is not opened at runtime.** The runtime app only talks to `app.db`. Nutrition data was pre-joined
> into `app.db.ingredients` by `seed_ingredients.py` during data prep — one canonical match per ingredient, decided
> upstream. Having the app query `nutrients.db` directly at runtime would require matching and disambiguation logic
> that belongs in the data pipeline, not the service layer. `DatabaseManager` stays focused on `app.db` only.

---

## Task 3 — Define `app.db` schema as `Schema.java` constants ✅

All DDL lives in `com.example.suppergeist.database.Schema` as string constants — one per table and index.
`DatabaseManager.init()` applies them in dependency order. No SQL files on disk.

---

## Task 4 — Wire `DatabaseManager.init()` into app startup ✅

*(Depends on Tasks 2 and 3)*

Call `DatabaseManager.init()` from the `init()` lifecycle method of `SuppergeistApplication`. Errors must be surfaced on
the JavaFX thread — the `start()` method shows an error alert if init failed:

```java
private SQLException initError;

@Override
public void init() throws Exception {
    try {
        DatabaseManager.init();
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        initError = e;
    }
}

@Override
public void start(Stage stage) {
    if (initError != null) {
        new Alert(Alert.AlertType.ERROR, "Database init failed: " + initError.getMessage()).showAndWait();
        Platform.exit();
        return;
    }
    // ... normal startup
}
```

**Done when:** `./gradlew run` starts cleanly, `app.db` is created if absent, and all tables exist.

---

## Task 5 — `AppSeedService` ✅

*(Depends on Task 4)*

A freshly initialized `app.db` has the correct schema but no data. `AppSeedService` runs immediately after `DatabaseManager.init()` and handles two bootstrap concerns: seeding the ingredient catalogue and ensuring a default user exists. Both checks are idempotent — they do nothing on subsequent launches.

This removes the need for any manual data script during normal app startup. The Python scripts remain useful for developer workflows (re-seeding after a schema reset, re-enriching the CSV from CoFID), but are no longer required to get a working app.

**Bootstrap sequence (as implemented):**

1. `DatabaseManager.init()` creates the schema (if absent)
2. `AppSeedService.seedIfEmpty(conn)` — if `ingredients` is empty, reads `ingredient_mapping.csv` from the classpath and inserts all rows in a single `executeBatch()`; otherwise skips and logs
3. `UserRepository.ensureDefaultUserExists()` — if no row with `id = 1` exists in `users`, inserts one; otherwise skips and logs

Both are called from `SuppergeistApplication.init()`. The default user step lives in `UserRepository` rather than `AppSeedService` but the behaviour is identical to the original spec.

**Bundling:** `ingredient_mapping.csv` lives at `src/main/resources/data/ingredient_mapping.csv`. This path is picked up by Gradle's standard resource processing and included in the built JAR. `AppSeedService` reads it via `getResourceAsStream("/data/ingredient_mapping.csv")`.

---

## Task 6 — `UserRepository` ✅

Read/write user data (including preferences) from the `users` table in `app.db`. Depends on Task 3 (table must exist).

All three methods implemented:

```java
public class UserRepository {
    public void ensureDefaultUserExists() throws SQLException { ... }
    public User getUser(int userId) throws SQLException { ... }
    public void savePreferences(User user) throws SQLException { ... }
}
```

Storage: `dietary_constraints` and `avoid_food_codes` serialised as comma-separated strings. `getUser` returns a
synthetic default `User` with empty preferences if the row doesn't exist.

Round-trip tests in `UserRepositoryTest` cover: default creation, idempotency, preference persistence, overwrite,
blank/null handling, and synthetic default for unknown IDs.

---

## Task 7 — Wire preferences sidebar 🔄

*(Depends on Task 6)*

**What's done:** `PreferencesSidebarController` is wired to `UserRepository`; servings spinner, week-start-day
`ChoiceBox`, show-calories / show-nutritional-info checkboxes, and the Save button all work end-to-end.
`MainController.initialize()` calls `preferencesSidebarController.loadUser(1)` on startup. `MainController`
reads `weekStartDay` from the loaded `User` and uses it to drive grid column ordering — no longer hardcoded.
An `onPreferencesSaved` callback triggers `refreshMealPlanGrid()` so the grid reacts immediately when
preferences are saved.

For development, `MainController` still uses a fixed reference date (`2026-04-06`) aligned with seeded data.
This is intentional and will be replaced once active-week navigation or automatic current-week plan loading
exists.

**Remaining:** dietary-constraint checkboxes exist in the FXML but are not wired to the model or save path;
avoid-food-codes is a static label placeholder only.

The preferences sidebar (`prefsSidebar` VBox) exists in the FXML; basic fields are bound and persisted.

### UI changes

- Text fields or checkboxes for common `dietaryConstraints` (e.g. vegetarian, gluten-free)
- Numeric field for `servingsPerMeal`
- **Avoid ingredients — searchable multi-select:**
  1. Search input field — filters the ingredient list; not stored
  2. Multi-select list — populated via `IngredientRepository.searchByName()`; selected items' food codes are persisted
  - On startup, pre-select any ingredients whose food code is in the loaded `avoidFoodCodes` set
- Save button that calls `UserRepository.savePreferences(...)`
- On startup, load preferences and populate fields

### Schema changes

None. `avoidFoodCodes` is stored as a comma-separated string in the `avoid_food_codes` column on `users`. Food codes never contain commas, so this is safe and sufficient.

### Repository changes

No structural changes to `UserRepository`. `savePreferences(...)` and `getUser(...)` already serialise/deserialise `avoidFoodCodes` as a comma-separated string.

Add a search method to `IngredientRepository` to drive the multi-select:

```java
public List<Ingredient> searchByName(String query) throws SQLException { ... }
```

```sql
SELECT id, name, food_code FROM ingredients WHERE name LIKE ? ORDER BY name LIMIT 50
```

The controller calls `IngredientRepository.searchByName()` — no SQL in the UI layer.

### Call-site change in `MainController`

Replace the hardcoded user ID `1` with the loaded/current user.

Keep `weekStartDay` as a display concern:
- load `weekStartDay` from `UserRepository`
- use it when calculating grid column ordering / visual week layout
- do not let it change meal-plan lookup in a way that makes an existing stored plan unreachable

Replace the temporary hardcoded `DayOfWeek.MONDAY` in UI layout logic with the loaded value from `UserRepository`.

> Temporary dev limitation: `referenceDate` may remain fixed to match seeded data until plan generation / active-week navigation is implemented.

**Done when:** avoid-food-codes survive a restart and are reloaded correctly; dietary-constraint checkboxes persist; `MainController` uses the loaded `weekStartDay` for grid column ordering.

---

## Task 7a — Consolidate user loading in `MainController` ⬜

*(Complete alongside Task 7 — required before Task 7 is considered closed)*

`MainController` currently loads the user twice: once via `preferencesSidebarController.loadUser(1)` and again inside `refreshMealPlanGrid()` via a direct `userRepository.getUser(1)` call. This is a known TODO in the code. It is not a correctness bug now, but Task 7 wires dietary constraints and avoid-ingredients into the same `User` object — at that point, two independent loads create two independent views of user state, and any field added to preferences doubles the number of places that need updating.

**Fix:** hold a single `User` reference in `MainController`. Load it once on startup; update it via the `onPreferencesSaved` callback when preferences are saved. Pass the cached `User` into `refreshMealPlanGrid()` rather than re-querying.

**Done when:** `userRepository.getUser()` is called exactly once per user action; `refreshMealPlanGrid()` uses the cached `User`; the TODO comment is removed.

---

## Task 8 — `MealIngredientRepository` ✅

Loads ingredient lines for a meal from the `meal_ingredients` table. `ShoppingListService` (Task 9) depends on this.

Both methods implemented:

- `getIngredientsForMeal(int mealId)` — returns `List<MealIngredient>` from `meal_ingredients`
- `getIngredientsWithNameForMeal(int mealId)` — returns `List<MealIngredientRow>`, joined with `ingredients` for the name, ordered alphabetically

`MealIngredientRow` is a package-private record in the same file as the repository.

`MealIngredientRepositoryTest` covers: empty list for unknown meal, field mapping, null unit, isolation between meals, multiple ingredients, joined name, alphabetical ordering.

**Done when:** both query methods work against the seeded DB; tests pass.

---

## Task 9 — `ShoppingListService` 🔄

*(Depends on Task 8)*

Derives an aggregated ingredient list from a `MealPlan`. Lives in `com.example.suppergeist.service`.

```java
public class ShoppingListService {
    public List<ShoppingItem> buildList(int mealPlanId) throws SQLException { ...}
}
```

`ShoppingItem` is a public record: `name`, `totalQuantity` (String — quantities summed when units match, concatenated when they differ), `category` (String — derived from `foodCode` prefix; `"General"` if unclassified or food code is null).

**Category mapping (presentation concern — not stored in DB):**

Category is derived in `ShoppingListService.determineCategory(String foodCode)` from the two-character CoFID prefix. It is not stored on `Ingredient` and is not in the database.

| Prefix(es) | Category            |
|-----------|---------------------|
| `11`      | Bakery & Grains     |
| `12`      | Dairy & Eggs        |
| `13`      | Vegetables & Beans  |
| `14`      | Fruit & Nuts        |
| `16`      | Fish                |
| `18`, `19`| Meat                |
| `17`, `50`| Food Cupboard       |
| null / other | General          |

Prefixes form loose but supermarket-aligned clusters — good enough for UX grouping; refinement deferred.

**Data requirement:** `MealIngredientRepository.getIngredientsWithNameForMeal()` must include `i.food_code` in its join query, and `MealIngredientRow` gains a `foodCode` field. No schema change required — `food_code` is already on `ingredients`.

**Algorithm (MVP):**

1. Load all `MealPlanEntry` rows for the plan
2. For each entry, load `MealIngredientRow` rows (joined name + food_code)
3. Aggregate by `ingredientId` (unambiguous; avoids silent failures on case/whitespace differences in names):
   - same unit → sum quantities
   - different units → concatenate as `"200 g, 3 tbsp"`
   - carry `name` and `foodCode` from the first row seen for that ID (they are stable per ingredient)
4. Derive `category` from `foodCode` prefix
5. Sort by category then name

> **Phase 3 note:** `NutritionService` will need numeric quantities and ingredient IDs — do not collapse these into
> the `totalQuantity` display string early. Keep `ingredientId` and raw quantity data available until after nutrition
> calculation, or compute nutrition upstream of `ShoppingListService` directly from `MealIngredientRow`.

**Done when:** `ShoppingListService.buildList()` returns a non-empty list for the seeded plan; duplicate ingredients are consolidated.

---

## Task 10 — Shopping list UI panel ⬜

*(Depends on Task 9)*

Add a shopping list panel to the main view. It can be a side panel or a tab — to be decided when the layout is
reviewed.

**Minimum viable contents:**

- Scrollable list of `ShoppingItem` entries with a checkbox per item (state held in-memory only)
- Item label shows `name` + `totalQuantity`
- "Copy to clipboard" button — plain text, one item per line
- Refresh triggered when a new plan is loaded

**Done when:** shopping list panel renders for the seeded plan; copy-to-clipboard produces readable plain text.

---

## Future Considerations

### SQL `ON DELETE` cascade behaviour

Foreign key relationships are defined in `Schema.java` but no `ON DELETE` behaviour has been specified (SQLite defaults
to `NO ACTION`). Decide cascade rules before implementing any delete operations:

| Parent deleted | Child rows in       | Expected behaviour                                                  |
|----------------|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `meal_plans`   | `meal_plan_entries` | CASCADE — entries are meaningless without their plan                |
| `meals`        | `meal_ingredients`  | CASCADE — ingredients list is part of the meal                      |
| `meals`        | `meal_plan_entries` | RESTRICT or SET NULL                                                |
| `ingredients`  | `meal_ingredients`  | RESTRICT — don't silently delete ingredient lines                   |
| `users`        | `meal_plans`        | CASCADE or RESTRICT — depends on whether user deletion is supported |

Update `Schema.java` once decided.

### Upgrade to SLF4J + Logback (Phase 2+)

Phase 1 uses `java.util.logging`. SLF4J + Logback is the right long-term choice: structured output, configurable
levels per package, and no platform-specific quirks. Add when the service layer grows enough that log verbosity needs
per-package control. Requires JPMS wiring: `requires org.slf4j` in `module-info.java`.

### Jackson dependency (Phase 3+)

Add `com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind` to `build.gradle.kts` and `requires com.fasterxml.jackson.databind`
to `module-info.java` when `MealPlanParser` is implemented. Not needed before then. (Phase 2 uses naive
`String.join`/`split` for preferences serialisation.)

### NutritionService (Phase 3)

`NutritionService` reads the inline nutrition columns already on `app.db.ingredients` — it does not query
`nutrients.db` at runtime. The data pipeline (`seed_ingredients.py`) made the food-identity decision once, upstream;
the app inherits clean, unambiguous data. There is no runtime `NutrientRepository` against the raw CoFID dataset.
